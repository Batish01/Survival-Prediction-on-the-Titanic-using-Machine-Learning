# ðŸš¢ Survival Prediction on the Titanic using Machine Learning

This project uses the classic Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using machine learning techniques in Python. It showcases a complete data science pipeline â€” from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

## ðŸ§  Objective

Build a classification model to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features like age, gender, ticket class, etc.

## ðŸ“¦ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## ðŸ§¹ Steps Followed

1. **Data Loading:** Loaded `train.csv` dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explored data using visualizations and summary statistics.
3. **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values and irrelevant columns.
4. **Feature Engineering:** Converted categorical data into numerical features.
5. **Model Training:** Used Logistic Regression as the ML model.
6. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated using accuracy score and prediction results.

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

Achieved a prediction accuracy of over **X%** (replace this with your actual accuracy). The model successfully predicts which passengers are more likely to survive.
