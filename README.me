# 🛳️ Survival Prediction on the Titanic using Machine Learning

This project uses the Titanic dataset from Kaggle to predict passenger survival using various machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 📊 Objective
The goal is to:
- Clean and explore the dataset
- Engineer relevant features
- Train ML models
- Evaluate and compare model accuracy

## 📁 Dataset
- [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)

## 🧠 ML Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

## ✅ Final Accuracy
> The best model gave an accuracy of **~81%** on the test set.

## 📌 How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `main.py`
3. Make sure required libraries are installed
